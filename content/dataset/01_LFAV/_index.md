summary: To achieve a better understanding of long form audio-visual videos, we propose to focus on the multisensory temporal event localization task, which essentially requires the model to predict the start and end time of each audio and visual event in the video. Concretely, we divide the video into several non-overlapping snippets, then predict the event categories of all snippets. To study the proposed multisensory temporal event localization task, we elaborately build a large-scale Long Form Audio-visual Video (LFAV) dataset with an  an average video length of 210 seconds and a total video length of 302 hours.
